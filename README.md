`nef`, short for [Nefertiti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nefertiti), mother of Ankhesenamun, is a toolset to ease the **creation of documentation** in the form of Xcode Playgrounds. It provides compile-time **verification** of documentation, exports it in **Markdown** format that can be consumed by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to generate websites, and export [Carbon](https://carbon.now.sh/) snippets for a given Xcode Playground.

`nef` is inspired by [ŒõNK](https://github.com/arrow-kt/ank) for Kotlin and [tut](https://github.com/tpolecat/tut) for Scala.

## üíª Installation

#### üìü Using [Homebrew](https://github.com/bow-swift/homebrew-nef) (preferred)

```bash
‚ûú brew install nef
```

> It will warn you if there is a missing dependency and will provide guidance to install it.

&nbsp;

#### üì¶ Using [Swift Package Manager](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/creating_a_swift_package_with_xcode)

`nef` can be consumed as a library in your **macOS project**.

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/bow-swift/nef.git", from: "{version}")
```

It is an excellent option if you want to use all nef features in your macOS app, even to build new tooling on top of nef.

> You can read more about how to use nef library in the [**nef site**](https://nef.bow-swift.io/docs/library/how-to-use-nef-library-/).

&nbsp;

#### üîå Using [Xcode Editor Extension](https://github.com/bow-swift/nef-plugin)

Some of `nef` features can be used directly in Xcode as an Extension. You can install it directly from [**App Store**](https://apps.apple.com/app/nef/id1479391704?mt=8) or downloading the last binary from the [**releases section**](https://github.com/bow-swift/nef-plugin/releases).

&nbsp;

## Usage

### üìÉ Creating a nef Playground

Xcode Playgrounds are a nice tool for prototyping and trying new concepts. However, third party libraries support is a bit cumbersome to add. One of the goals of `nef` is to make the creation of an Xcode Playground easier with support for one or more libraries.

By default, `nef` can create an Xcode Playground with support for [Bow](http://bow-swift.io), the Functional Programming companion library for Swift.

```bash
‚ûú nef playground
```

<p align="center">
<img src="assets/nef-playground.png" height="100">
</p>

And you can use the following option to specify the name for the `nef Playground` that you are creating:

```bash
‚ûú nef playground --output ~/Desktop --name LatestBowProject
```

It will create an Xcode project with support for the latest available version of Bow, named `LatestBowProject` in your `~/Desktop`. If you open this `nef playground`, you will find an Xcode Playground where you can import Bow or any of its modules, and start trying some of its features.

By default, `nef playground` will be created for iOS platform. If you need to change it, you can use the `--platform` option.

```bash
‚ûú nef playground --platform osx
```

If you need to take advantage of nef in your Xcode Playgrounds, you can transform your Xcode Playground into a nef Playground using the following command:

```bash
‚ûú nef playground --playground <Xcode Playground>
```

Where `<Xcode Playground>` is the path to your Xcode Playground.

###

<details>
<summary>üì£ You can create a nef Playground compatible with any different Bow version, branch or commit; even third-party dependencies</summary>

###

> Note: The next options are mutually exclusive.

###

- `--bow-version <x.y.z>`: Specify the version of Bow that you want to use in the project. This option lets you test an old version of the library in an Xcode Playground. Example:

```bash
‚ûú nef playground --name OldBowProject --bow-version 0.3.0
```

##

- `--bow-branch <branch name>`: Specify the branch of Bow that you want to use in the project. This option lets you test features of Bow that are still in development in a branch that has not been merged or released yet. Example:

```bash
‚ûú nef playground --name BranchBowProject --bow-branch master
```

##

- `--bow-commit <commit hash>`: Specify the commit hash of Bow that you want to use in the project. This option lets you test features of Bow exactly at the moment you need, released or not. Example:

```bash
‚ûú nef playground --name CommitBowProject --bow-commit e70c739067be1f5700f8b692523e1bb8931c7236
```

##

- `--podfile <podfile>`: Specify a **Podfile** with your own dependencies. This option lets you create a Playground with support for other libraries. Create a `Podfile` listing your dependencies and pass it to `nef`. Example:

Your `Podfile`, located in `./folder/dependencies`:

```ruby
target 'MyPodsProject' do
  platform :osx, '10.14'
  use_frameworks!

  pod 'Bow', '~> 0.3.0'
end
```

```bash
‚ûú nef playground --name MyPodsProject --podfile ./folder/dependencies/Podfile
```

##

- `--cartfile <cartfile>`: Specify a **Cartfile** with your dependencies. Create a `Cartfile` listing your dependencies and pass it to `nef`. Example:

Your `Cartfile`, located in `./folder/dependencies`:

```ruby
github "bow-swift/Bow"
```

```bash
‚ûú nef playground --name MyCarthageProject --cartfile ./folder/dependencies/Cartfile
```

</details>

&nbsp;

### üî® Compiling a nef Playground

Xcode lets you check for correctness of your Xcode Playground and run it. However, Apple does not provide us commands to compile an Xcode Playground, as they do for building Xcode projects. It is particularly useful in Continuous Integration when you want to verify that your playgrounds are not broken when the libraries you depend on are updated. `nef` has an option to compile a `nef Playground`. To do this, you can run the following command:

```bash
‚ûú nef compile --project <nef playground>
```
> If you need to transform your Xcode Playground into a nef Playground you can check [Creating a nef Playground](#-creating-a-nef-playground) section.

Where `<nef playground>` is the path to `nef Playground` where your playgrounds are located. Also, you can use the following option with this command:

- `--use-cache`: Use cached dependencies if it is possible, in another case, it will download them. Example:

```bash
‚ûú nef compile --project <nef playground> --use-cache
```

You can also clean the result of the compilation:

```bash
‚ûú nef clean --project <nef playground>
```

&nbsp;

### üì≤ Creating a Playground Book

Swift Playgrounds is a revolutionary app that makes possible to write Swift code on an iPad. In the latest updates, Swift Playgrounds 3.x has added a new feature: [UserModules](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift_playgrounds/structuring_content_for_swift_playgrounds/using_modules_to_share_code_in_a_playground_book); it lets you include swift code and make it available across multiple chapters like modules.

nef takes advantage of these new possibilities and advancements in Swift Package Manager to build a Playground Book with external dependencies from a Swift Package specification.

Given a `Package.swift` like the next one:
```swift
// swift-tools-version:5.0

import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "BowProject",
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/bow-swift/bow.git", from: "0.7.0"),
    ]
)
```

you can run the following command:

```bash
‚ûú nef ipad --name PlaygroundName --package Package.swift --output ~/Desktop
```

It will create a Playground Book (`PlaygroundName`) with support for the external dependencies and save it in `~/Desktop`

Options:
- `--name`: the name for the Playground Book to build.
- `--package`: path to the Swift Package specification.
- `--output`: path where the resulting Playground Book will be generated.

&nbsp;

### üîñ Generating a Markdown project

Xcode Playgrounds let you write comments in Markdown format using the symbols `//:` for single line comments, or `/*: */` for multiline comments. Inside these comments, you can use any Markdown syntax; an example:

```swift
/*:
 # This is a heading 1

 This is regular text. *This is bold text*. [This is a link](http://bow-swift.io).
 */
protocol MyProtocol {}

//: ## This is a single line heading 2
```

It makes Xcode Playgrounds the proper tool to write an article with compilable examples. The command provided by `nef` to generate the Markdown files is:

```bash
‚ûú nef markdown --project <nef playground> --output <path>
```

Options:

- `--project`: Path to your nef Playground.
- `--output`: Path where the resulting Markdown project will be generated.

&nbsp;

### üåê Generating Markdown files for Jekyll

As you can write comments in [Markdown](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Xcode/Reference/xcode_markup_formatting_ref/index.html) in Xcode Playgrounds, this makes it very suitable to write documentation with compilable examples.
Leveraging this, `nef` can create Markdown files that can be consumed from Jekyll to generate a microsite. The command to do this is:

```bash
‚ûú nef jekyll --project <nef playground> --output <path> --main-page <main-page>
```

Options:

- `--project`: Path to your nef Playground.
- `--output`: Path where the resulting Markdown files will be generated.
- `--main-page`: Optional. Path to 'README.md' file to be used as the index page of the generated microsite.

###

<details>
<summary>üì£ How to setup a nef Playgroud for Jekyll?</summary>

###

`nef` finds all the Xcode Playgrounds in a nef Playground. Each playground is considered a section in the generated microsite structure. For each page in a playground, an entry in the corresponding section is created. The page is transformed from Swift to Markdown using the syntax described above. As a result, a directory structure matching the nef Playground structure is generated, together with a `sidebar.yml` that can be used as a menu in Jekyll.

`nef` adds some commands to modify the Markdown transformation process. All `nef` commands are included as Swift comments. They begin with `// nef:begin:` and end with `// nef:end`. The supported commands are:

- `header`: It lets you add metadata to a playground page to be consumed by Jekyll. You must provide the layout that this page will use in Jekyll. The remaining attributes are optional, and you may include any of them according to your Jekyll configuration. `nef` will take care of the permalinks as well. Example (at the beginning of the playground page):

```swift
// nef:begin:header
/*
  layout: docs
*/
// nef:end
```

- `hidden`: It lets you hide a portion of your playground in the output Markdown file. It is useful to hide imports or supporting utility code to make an example work. Example:

```swift
// nef:begin:hidden
import Bow // This will be hidden in the Markdown file
// nef:end

struct Person {} // This will be present in the Markdown file
```
</details>

&nbsp;

### üåÅ Exporting Carbon code snippets

Xcode Playgrounds are a great place for prototyping and trying new concepts. Oftentimes we want to share some Swift snippets. `Carbon` is a cool tool for this, and `nef` nicely integrates with it. You can take your nef Playground, write several pieces of code, and keep it verified. Later, you can export all your code snippets with the next command:

```bash
‚ûú nef carbon --project <nef playground> --output <path>
```

Options:

- `--project`: Path to your nef Playground.
- `--output`: Path where the resulting Carbon snippets will be generated.

#### Example of use

If we have a project created by `nef`, and an Xcode playground with the next content:
```swift
let example = "This is an example"
print("nef is super cool: \(example)")

// nef is super cool: This is an example
```

Running the following command, we will customize the `background color` to ![#d54048](https://placehold.it/15/d54048/000000?text=+) bow, `hide the number of lines`, and set the export file to `size 3`:

```bash
‚ûú nef carbon --project . --output ~/Desktop/nef-carbon --background bow --size 3 --show-lines false
```
