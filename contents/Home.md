`nef`, short for [Nefertiti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nefertiti), mother of Ankhesenamun, is a command line tool to ease the creation of documentation in the form of Swift Playgrounds. It provides compile-time verification of documentation and exports it in Markdown format that can be consumed by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to generate websites.

`nef` is inspired by [Î›NK](https://github.com/arrow-kt/ank) for Kotlin and [tut](https://github.com/tpolecat/tut) for Scala.

## ðŸ“¥ Installation

`nef` can be installed using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh). `nef` needs Xcode and [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org) as dependencies. It will warn you if there is a missing dependency and will provide guidance to install it.
